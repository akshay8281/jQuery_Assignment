            jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies various tasks related to HTML
            document
            traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
            interactions for web
            development. jQuery was created by John Resig and released in 2006. Its primary goal is to make it easier to
            write
            client-side JavaScript code.

            <p>Some key features and capabilities of jQuery include:</p>
            <li>DOM Manipulation: jQuery provides a concise and cross-browser-compatible way to manipulate the Document
                Object Model
                (DOM), allowing developers to easily update, delete, or add elements to a web page.</li>
            <li>Event Handling: jQuery simplifies the process of handling events such as clicks, keypresses, and mouse
                movements. This
                makes it easier to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.</li>
            <li>Animation: jQuery includes methods for creating smooth animations on web pages. This can be useful for
                creating visually
                appealing effects or transitions.</li>
            <li>AJAX: jQuery simplifies AJAX interactions, allowing developers to make asynchronous requests to the
                server and update
                parts of a webpage without requiring a full page reload.</li>
            <li>Cross-browser Compatibility: One of jQuery's strengths is its ability to abstract away the differences
                between various
                web browsers, providing a consistent programming interface that works across different environments.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To use jQuery on a webpage, you typically include the jQuery library in your HTML document, and then you can
            start using
            jQuery methods in your JavaScript code. While jQuery was very popular in the past, with the advent of modern
            web
            development and the improvements in native JavaScript and browser capabilities, some developers now prefer
            using vanilla
            JavaScript or other libraries/frameworks. However, jQuery is still in use in many existing projects and can
            be a helpful
            tool for certain tasks.</p>
